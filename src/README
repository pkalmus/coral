(Note: Zeke Hausfather says HadISST is best for 1x1.)


THE PYTHON scripts, in order:

reef_locations.py: Run once at beginning of analysis, to create 1 km reef locations from UNEP-WCMC shapefile.
/raid8/pkalmus/data/coral/data/location/14_001_WCMC008_CoralReefs2018_v4_1/01_Data/locationsWCMCv41.nc
/raid8/pkalmus/data/coral/data/location/14_001_WCMC008_CoralReefs2018_v4_1/01_Data/locationsWCMCv41.csv
Note that:
 + we do NOT use "all touched" (a gdal_rasterize option)
 + lat_extent = [-34.3, 32.525]
 + there are 125479 reef locations (again, w/o all touched)
 + Dimensions:    (lat: 6683, lon: 36000)

reef_locations_coarse.py: create reef_grid_coarse.csv and nn_grid_coarse.csv, to regrid and ravel GCMs to reefs

regrid_bcdp.py: Get "best" member from each model group, determine mean resolution for each model, and regrid to a single reasonable resolution. Time homogenize. Produces models.txt. Also examines resolutions of the models.

regrid_reef.py: Take gridded GCM and HadISST files, and produce "ravel" versions (with single index) that only include reef locations and nn locations. Produces models_reef.txt.
